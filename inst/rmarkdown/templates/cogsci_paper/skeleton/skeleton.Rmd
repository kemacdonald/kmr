# Introduction 

For standard spoken papers and standard posters, the entire contribution (including figures, references, everything) can be no longer than six pages. For abstract posters, the entire contribution can be no longer than one page. For symposia, the entire contribution can be no longer than two pages.

The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns with an
overall width of 7 inches (17.8 cm) and length of 9.25 inches (23.5
cm), with 0.25 inches between the columns. Leave two line spaces
between the last author listed and the text of the paper. The left
margin should be 0.75 inches and the top margin should be 1 inch.
\textbf{The right and bottom margins will depend on whether you use
  U.S. letter or A4 paper, so you must be sure to measure the width of
  the printed text.} Use 10~point Times Roman with 12~point vertical
spacing, unless otherwise specified.

The title should be in 14~point, bold, and centered. The title should
be formatted with initial caps (the first letter of content words
capitalized and the rest lower case). Each author's name should appear
on a separate line, 11~point bold, and centered, with the author's
email address in parentheses. Under each author's name list the
author's affiliation and postal address in ordinary 10~point type.

Indent the first line of each paragraph by 1/8~inch (except for the
first paragraph of a new section). Do not add extra vertical space
between paragraphs.

# Method 

# Results

All artwork must be very dark for purposes of reproduction and should
not be hand drawn. Number figures sequentially, placing the figure
number and caption, in 10 point, after the figure with one line space
above the caption and one line space below it. If necessary, leave extra white space at
the bottom of the page to avoid splitting the figure and figure
caption. You may float figures to the top or bottom of a column, or
set wide figures across both columns.

## Plots

You can use R chunks directly to plot graphs.

```{r plot, fig.pos = "ht", fig.width=3, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "R plot" }
x <- 0:100
y <- 2 * (x + rnorm(length(x), sd = 3) + 3)
ggplot(data = data.frame(x, y), 
       aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Images

You can read the image using png package for example and plot it like a regular plot using grid.raster from the grid package. With this method you have full control of the size of your image. **Note: Image must be in .png file format for the readPNG function to work.**

```{r image, fig.pos = "ht", fig.align='center', fig.width=3, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Local image file"}
img <- readPNG("figs/lab_logo_stanford.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

## Tables

Number tables consecutively; place the table number and title (in
10~point) above the table with one line space above the caption and
one line space below it, as in Table~\ref{sample-table}. You may float
tables to the top or bottom of a column, set wide tables across both
columns.

You can use the xtable function in the xtable package.

```{r xtable, results="asis"}
n <- 100
x <- rnorm(n)
y <- 2*x + rnorm(n)
out <- lm(y ~ x)
tab <- xtable(summary(out)$coef, digits=c(0, 2, 2, 1, 2))
print(tab, type="latex", comment = F)
```

## Footnotes and citations

You can add footnotes by including raw latex like this \footnote{Footnote 1}.

In-text citations look like this: @Garnier2007. Or you can use parthentical citations like this [@Garnier2007].
