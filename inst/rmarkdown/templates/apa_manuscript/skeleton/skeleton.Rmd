You can use R chunks directly to plot graphs.

```{r, graph, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Figure caption'}
require("ggplot2")
x <- 0:100
y <- 2 * (x + rnorm(length(x), sd = 3) + 3)
ggplot(data = data.frame(x, y), 
       aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
